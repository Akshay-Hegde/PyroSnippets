h2. Installation

To install, add the "chunks" folder to the modules folder or your addons folder.

h2. Usage

After installing if you are using a PyroCMS version less than 1.1, autoload the Chunks library (chunks/Chunks). This will allow access to chunks in your page layouts.

If you are using PyroCMS 1.1.x you will NOT need to add the chunks library to your config/autoload array.
